# Receipt Form

This application serves as a way to automatically create a receipt form for usage in Linjeforeningen Online.
It is created as an over-engineered React webapp, because it is fun.

## How to run

This project uses the Nextjs framework to run both the back-end and front-end.
The following scripts will let you run or build the application:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `./next` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
